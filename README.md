# 690-Mini-Project-2

This dataset includes the Suicide Attempts in Shandong, China from year 2009-2011.This dataset includes if the person was hospitalized or died from the suicide attempt. The year and month of the attempt. It also describes the age, sex, education, urban or not and occupation of the individual. Also, the dataset includes the method used for the suicide attempt.

I choose this dataset because due to ever increasing competition and stress many people are attempting suicides as they are not able to cope up with the race. I want to do an exploratory analysis on which and how people attempt suicides.
